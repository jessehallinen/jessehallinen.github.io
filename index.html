                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>I have used C# actively since 2010 and Unity game engine since 2012, so I have a pretty good understanding about those.</p>
                    <p>In 2014 I registered myself as a sole proprietor and started to develop mobile games using Unity and C#.
						I'm capable of 3D modeling and digital art to a certain degree and I make the most of the 3D models and textures/art I use in my
						games by myself.</p>
                    <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Software engineering from the JAMK University of Applied Sciences.</p>
                    <p>I spent three months making mobile games in a mobile game company called Star Arcade as a part of my practical training.
						I also spent two months doing automated tests using the Robot framework and Selenium in a JAMK's own project.</p>
                    <p>I have also done some hobby projects using varying technologies like Python, Tensorflow, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, MySQL, C++ and Lua.</p>

                    <h3>SURVIVAL FPS GAME WITH MAGIC</h3>
                    <p>A first-person shooter survival game with magic. The goal of this project was to make a local multiplayer split-screen game
                        with as many AI enemies as possible.</p>
                    <h4>Development problems and solutions</h4>
                    <p>The very annoying problem with Unity is that it doesn't really support split-screen games. Unity doesn't allow multiple
                    audio listeners	or event systems, so the only option is to write some scripts yourself but it is hard to get them working
                    properly in every situation. Audio listener problem can be solved by keeping the audio listener in same position and moving
                    audio sources around it in relation to the every player position. The event system problem can be solved by modifying the
                    GUISystem files in UnityExtensions folder to allow multiple eventsystems or by writing some scripts on top of the eventsystem.
                    Both of the solutions are cumbersome.</p>
                    <p>The other obvious problem was how to get hundreds of enemies and still get high framerate. There are many small things to do
                    to improve fps but one of the biggest things was to find out how to make the enemies be as lightweight as possible. After
                    testing every combination this is what I found out:
                        <ul>
                            <li>An enemy model made from boxes vs a few hundred polygon model. A noticeable fps difference so if only want as many
                            enemies as possible then use the box model.</li>
                            <li>Enemy ragdolls. These are heavy so better not to use</li>
                            <li>Accurate hit colliders for every limb. Kind of heavy so better not to use unless really want to be able to shoot enemies
                            in the foot or arm.</li>
                            <li>NavMeshAgent vs custom solution. NavMeshAgents are actually pretty fast so they can be used.</li>
                            <li>Enemy rigidbodies. Somewhat heavy so better not to use.</li>
                            <li>Rigging and animations in Blender vs Unity animations with no rigging which requires separate game objects for every
                            limb. Using Blender for rigging and animations was the more lightweight solution.</li>
                            <li>Using only the minimum amount of bones in enemy skeletons gave some extra fps.</li>
                            <li>Removing all the unnecessary child transforms from the enemy game objects, like IK bones. This gave a few more fps.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Castles in War</h3>
                    <p>A strategy game where a player needs to conquer the enemy castles. The castles have multiple
                    different upgrade options and there are also gold mines which generate gold faster than castles.
                    The game is designed for mobile devices and was published in App Store and Google Play,
                    but currently it's only available in
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Hoarfrost.CastlesinWar&hl=en_US">Google Play</a>.</p>
                    <h4>Development problems and solutions</h4>
                    <p>The knights couldn't be individual game objects because performance was too bad. The solution was to parent every
                    knight in a same queue under an other game object and then move that queue object back and forth to create an
                    illusion of the knights continuously moving forward. This created a new problem: cutting knight queue at the correct
                    position. This was solved by calculating how many knights fit between the cut position and the end of the queue object.</p>

                    <h3>Dwarven Platoon</h3>
                    <p>A kind of endless runner type game where the group of dwarves must run as far as they can while avoiding deadly traps.</p>
                    <h4>Development problems and solutions</h4>
                    <p>The problem was the navigation because Unity didn't support stitching navMeshes together properly. I tried to use some beta
                    version of the new Unity navMesh but it was in a too early stage of development. So finally I wrote a simple navigation myself.</p>

                    <h3>King's Castle TD</h3>
                    <p>A tower defence game where the player needs to protect the king from the monsters. The twist here is that the player
                    can build walls to change the route the monsters can take. The towers can be build on top of the walls.
                    <h4>Development problems and solutions</h4>
                    <p>There could be so many monsters at the same time that towers couldn't just loop through every monster and calculate
                    which one was closest to the king. This was solved by splitting the map area into multiple squares called buckets. Each bucket
                    hold the list of the monsters which currently were in the bucket's area. Then each tower needed only to check the buckets closest
                    to it.</p>

                    <h3>World Conquering Game</h3>
                    <p>A turn-based strategy game where the player needs to conquer the whole world. Kind of like Risk board game. The player can
                    choose any nation as a starting point. All countries are divided into smaller regions and each nation gets reinforcement units
                    at the start of their turn based on the number of regions the nation holds. Before battle the player positions his troops and then
                    in the actual battle the player has no control and the troops just charge against the enemy.</p>
                    <h4>Development problems and solutions</h4>
                    <p>The biggest problem was creating an accurate world map where countries were divided into smaller regions. The solution required
                    multiple tools. First I downloaded geographical data from 
                    <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com">naturalearthdata.com</a> and a list of the world flags from somewhere
                    (Couldn't find the site anymore). Then I run the geographical world data through the
                    <a href="https://www.mapshaper.org">mapshaper.org</a> to get more simplified version of the map. Then I wrote a dozen of python
                    scripts for QGIS (a geographic information system application for editing geospatial data) to split the map into smaller regions
                    and to convert the world map data into a format I could use in Unity to generate the world map.</p>

                    <p>The problem was how to move hundreds of units at the same time and keep high framerate. One of the solutions was to use the
